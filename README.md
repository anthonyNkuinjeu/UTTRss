This application was developed using the Appcelerator Titanium framework and Titanium Studio which can 
be downloaded here: http://appcelerator.com/

Titanium is a cross-platform Javascript-to-Native binding approach to mobile development, which produces 
highly usable, well performing native mobile applications from one central Javascript application source source.
The Javascript code is fully compliant, standards-based scripting, though the application APIs are proprietary 
to the Titanium platform. However, Appcelerator has open-sourced their code base, which was sufficient 
for us to choose their platform on which to build our application.
