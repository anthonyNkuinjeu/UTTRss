Presentation of UTTRss
-----------------------

UTTRss is a mobile application dedicaded to my university - "University of Technology of Troyes" - UTT (www.utt.fr).
UTTRss will be FREE and available for android, ios and blackberry devices. (This is the android version).

With this app you will have access to:
- All kind of information about the university. ie: administrative information, daily news, sport, cultural events, etc.
- All videos concerning the University.
- The official address book.
- Some practical information for new students in Troyes.
- A completed guide for all the courses given at UTT.

More features will be added in the future. Please, feel free to look at the Wiki for more details.

This project was initiated by Anthony NKUINJEU (me) and Steve WANDJI (we are both UTT students).
Most of the code was written by Anthony NKUINJEU and Steve WANDJI.

Some parts of the code (only the section "Videos -> l'UTT sur Canal32") were taken from 
the NYSenateMobileApp source code available here: https://github.com/nysenatecio/NYSenateMobileApp

This application was developed using the Appcelerator Titanium framework and Titanium Studio which can 
be downloaded here: http://appcelerator.com/

Titanium Studio is a cross-platform Javascript-to-Native binding approach to mobile development, which produces 
highly usable, well performing native mobile applications from one central Javascript application source source.
The Javascript code is fully compliant, standards-based scripting, though the application APIs are proprietary 
to the Titanium platform. However, Appcelerator has open-sourced their code base, which was sufficient 
for us to choose their platform on which to build our application.
